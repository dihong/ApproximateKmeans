/*
 * This program implements the word sense disambiguation algorithm in:
 * 	D. Yarowsky, "Unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation Rivaling Supervised Methods", 1995.
 * How to use:
 *	1) train a classifier for word to be disambiguated: uwsd -train /path/to/training/text /path/to/seeds /path/to/classifer word-to-be-disambiguated
 *	2) Disambiguate the same word for new sentenses:    uwsd -test /path/to/classifer /path/to/ambtext word-to-be-disambiguated
 * Description:
 *	/path/to/training/text:     A path of a training file that contains training text for word to be disambiguated, one document (e.g. tweet) per line.
 *	/path/to/seeds:		    	A path of a seed file. The number of lines in this file is equal to the number of different senses for the word.
 *				    			Each line contains one or more keywords that ACCURATELY describe the sense at that line.
 * 	/path/to/classifer:         A path specifies where the classifer (decision rules) will be saved.
 *	word-to-be-disambiguated:	The word to be disambiguated, e.g. tank or bank.
 * 	/path/to/ambtext:   		A path to text to be disambiguated.
